Germany's Top Security Official Intends To Meet With Snowden.
Germany's top security official says he will try to organize a meeting between German investigators and Edward Snowden if he's willing to give details about the National Security Agency's alleged monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel and other politicians' communications.
Hans-Peter Friedrich was quoted by Die Zeit newspaper Friday saying that "we will find a way, if Mr. Snowden is willing to talk." His spokesman Jens Teschke confirmed the comments, saying "we want clarification and we want further information." He said he assumed such a meeting would be in Russia.
Opposition Greens lawmaker Hans-Christian Stroebele said he met with Snowden, a former NSA contractor, in Moscow on Thursday and that he was prepared to travel to Germany to testify.
Germany's parliament is expected to discuss the NSA's alleged activities Nov. 18.
