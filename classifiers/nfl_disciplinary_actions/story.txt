Atlanta Falcons to lose NFL draft pick for fake crowd noise in stadium.
The team will also pay a fine, and its president has been suspended from his position as the chairman of NFL's competition committee.
The NFL announced on March 30 that the Atlanta Falcons must forfeit a fifth-round pick in the 2016 draft and pay a $350,000 fine for pumping artificial crowd noise into the Georgia Dome at moments when opposing teams were calling plays during the 2013 and 2014 seasons.
"What took place was wrong and nowhere near the standards by which we run our business."
Blank called the violation "embarrassing" and will not appeal the ruling. The NFL named former Falcons marketing director Roddy White as the person "directly responsible for the violation," but Falcons President Rich McKay, who was not aware of the violation, will be suspended from his position as the chairman of the league's competition committee.
