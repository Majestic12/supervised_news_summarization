Netflix has renewed Marvel's Daredevil for a second season, the streaming service announced Tuesday.
The series will undergo a behind-the-scenes shuffle, however, as Doug Petrie (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Marco Ramirez (Sons of Anarchy) will take over showrunning duties from Steven DeKnight. Ramirez and Petrie will also serve as executive producers alongside series creator Drew Goddard (Cabin in the Woods) and Marvel Television's Jeph Loeb.
Daredevil stars Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer who fights injustice as the vigilante superhero Daredevil at night. The series debuted to positive reviews earlier this month and also features Rosario Dawson, Vincent D'Onofrio, Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, and Vondie Curtis Hall.
Daredevil is the first of five planned Marvel series at Netflix. Marvel characters Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist will all get their own shows before uniting along with Daredevil in a Defenders series.
