YouTube strikes original content deal with DreamWorks unit.
Google bought YouTube in 2006, and is now trying to turn the platform into a destination for high-quality video.
YouTube on April 28 announced an original content partnership with AwesomenessTV, a multichannel network owned by Dreamworks. YouTube and AwesomenessTV will work together to create an unspecified number of original films over the next two years.
YouTube's partnership with AwesomenessTV was announced on the same day that YouTube also announced exclusive content deals with well-known YouTube creators the Fine Brothers, Prank vs. Prank, Joey Graceffa, and Smosh.
"Google does not break out how much revenue YouTube generates, though the Wall Street Journal reported in February that YouTube generated a total of $4 billion in revenue in 2014. It did not generate any profit. One source said YouTube is "roughly break-even.""
"We're here to help you: from promotion to channel management to content optimization, we have the resources and programs to support you."
YouTube has taken a number of steps to help attract advertisers to the site, including letting certain high-profile producers use professional studio facilities in cities like London, Los Angeles, and New York.
Americans between the ages of 13 and 18 now consider YouTube personalities like Ian Andrew Hecox and Anthony Padilla (a comedy duo better known as Smosh) and Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (known as PewDiePie) to be more influential than more traditional celebrities, a Variety survey has revealed.
Fullscreen, a large YouTube video production company partly owned by AT&T, released a tool March 25 for its content creators to upload their videos directly to Facebook. The move came shortly after Facebook began letting users embed natively hosted videos across the web.
