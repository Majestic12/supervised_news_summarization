Senate approves Loretta Lynch to be next US attorney general.
In Nov. 2014, President Obama nominated U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to replace Eric Holder after Holder announced he would step down. Her confirmation was delayed over an unrelated Senate bill.
The Senate confirmed Lynch to be the next attorney general April 23 in a 56-43 vote. When she is sworn in by President Obama, Lynch will become the first African-American woman to hold the post.
Republicans had delayed Lynch's nomination after Democrats blocked a human trafficking bill over a provision about abortion. Senators eventually reached a deal on the human trafficking bill, and the bill passed 99-0 on April 23.
Lynch was questioned during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 28. Lynch, who defended Obama's executive action on immigration, echoed the administration's position that it is not possible to deport millions with limited resources. She said the executive action is "reasonable," as it prioritizes the deportation of criminals.
Lynch also addressed topics ranging from terrorism to marijuana. Lynch said she disagrees with President Obama's view that marijuana is not more dangerous than alcohol and that she does not support legalizing it. Lynch described NSA intelligence gathering as "constitutional and effective."
"Ms. Lynch is a strong, independent prosecutor who has twice led one of the most important U.S. Attorney's Offices in the country."
Lynch, 55, currently serves as U.S. Attorney for Eastern New York, which encompasses Brooklyn, Queens, State Island and Long Island. She was appointed to the post by Obama in 2010. She has supervised several public corruption cases.
Eric Holder is the country's first African American attorney general, and currently the fourth longest-serving. During his tenure he has pushed for civil rights, by refusing to defend the law that barred same-sex marriage, and by investigating the shooting deaths of Travyon Martin and Michael Brown.
