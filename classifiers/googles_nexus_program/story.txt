Nexus 7 tablet no longer for sale from Google.
The Nexus 7 won critical praise for its high build quality and low price.
The Nexus 7 is no longer available from Google's official online store. Its removal was first reported on April 24. The tablet is still available in limited quantities from other retailers, including Amazon and eBay.
Nexus 7 models were released in 2012 and 2013, both of which won high praise from critics. When they were first released, Gizmodo called them the best small form-factor tablets available. The Nexus 7 was superseded in Nov. 2014 by the Nexus 9 (pictured), which has a larger screen and faster internals.
"Advances in computing are driven at the intersection of hardware and software. That's why we've always introduced Nexus devices alongside our platform releases. Rather than creating software in the abstract, we work with hardware partners to build Nexus devices to help push the boundaries of what's possible."
Google in Oct. 2014 announced the Nexus 9 and Nexus 6 smartphone. Both devices were released the following month alongside Lollipop, the latest version of Android.
The Nexus 6 largely resembles the Moto X (2014), Motorola's 5.2-inch smartphone, and is the largest smartphone so far produced by Google. It starts at $649 (unlocked).
Google confirmed March 12 that it is no longer selling the Nexus 5 (pictured). The smartphone, which was built by LG, was first released in Oct. 2013 and was generally well received by critics. Google said it stopped selling the Nexus 5 to focus on the Nexus 6.
