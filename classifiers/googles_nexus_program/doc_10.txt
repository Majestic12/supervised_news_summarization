PSA: The 2013 Nexus 7 has been discontinued.
It had a great run, but Google has today discontinued the 2013-edition Nexus 7. The device was arguably—and is still to this this day—one of the best options when it comes to mid-range Android tablets. You may not be able to grab it on the Google Store anymore, but several places are offering the device at decent prices. On eBay, you can find several options including one that’s $185 refurbished.
