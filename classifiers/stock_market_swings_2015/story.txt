Tech stocks push Nasdaq, S&P500 to record highs.
The Nasdaq has had two consecutive days of record highs.
The Nasdaq Composite added 36 points, closing at 5,092, April 24, a new record high. The S&P500 closed up 4.7 points to 2,117. Both indices were pushed by a positive reaction to earnings reports from Amazon, Google and Microsoft.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 21 points and closed at 18,080. The index lagged behind the Nasdaq and S&P500 due to poor performances from some of its heavier weighted stocks.
