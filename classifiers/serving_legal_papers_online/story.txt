Judge gives NY woman permission to serve husband divorce papers via Facebook.
Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku of New York will be served a divorce summons by way of a private Facebook message after avoiding communication with his wife.
"We tried everything, including hiring a private detective â€” and nothing."
The Daily News said on April 6 that a NY judge ruled that Ellanora Baidoo, 26, will be able to serve her "elusive" husband divorce papers via Facebook. The couple, both from Ghana, married in 2009 and faced problems soon after when Blood-Dzraku refused to hold a traditional Ghanian wedding ceremony.
The report states that the defendant has only been in touch with his wife via telephone and Facebook. Her lawyer was given permission to serve the summons via Facebook once a week for three weeks, or "until acknowledged."
Blood-Dzraku left his last known residence in 2011. He has no record with the DMV, nor forwarding address with the post office, and there is no billing address attached to his prepaid cell phone. Spinnell said the ruling was "necessary," as the defendant refused to make himself available to be served.
In Sept. 2014, the New York Post reported a case that involved Staten Island man Noel Biscocho, who was trying to serve his ex-wife legal papers informing her that he would stop paying child support because their son had turned 21. Biscocho had been unsuccessful at serving the papers using conventional methods.
After Biscocho proved that his ex-wife had an active Facebook account, Staten Island Support Magistrate Gregory Gliedman ruled Sept. 12, 2014, that he should be allowed to serve the papers via Facebook. The ruling was the first of its kind in New York and the first in the United States that was not an attempt to serve someone overseas.
