The third annual World Happiness Report has been released by the United Nations.
The UN's Sustainable Development Solutions Network, in partnership with Columbia University's Earth Institute, released the third annual "World Happiness Report" on April 23 for 158 countries. The project aims to show how human happiness is a factor when gauging the development of nations.
The most happy nations in the world according to the 2015 report: Switzerland, Iceland, Denmark, Norway and Canada. The least happy nations in the world, according the report, are Togo, Burundi, Benin, Rwanda, and Syria.
"The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. They reflect a new worldwide demand for more attention to happiness as a criteria for government policy."
The report endeavors to measure overall life satisfaction country-by-country, factoring in conditions such as freedom, life expectancy and social support services.
The U.S. ranked 15th in the 2015 report--ahead of the UK (21nd), Ireland (18th) and Japan (46rd).
