Baoding Takes Top Slot as China City With Worst Air Quality.
Baoding, a city of more than 11 million people sitting 150 kilometers (93 miles) southwest of Beijing, has been declared the city in China with the most polluted air.
Baoding topped a list of major cities in China that failed to meet government standards for allowable concentrations of pollutants, according to a statement posted to the website of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The survey showed that 66 of the 74 cities, or 89 percent, fell short of requirements, with Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, remaining home to seven of the 10 cities with the dirtiest air.
Though an improvement from 2013 when 96 percent of the surveyed cities failed to meet standards, the results serve as a reminder of the toll on the nation’s environment following years of economic development. China’s leaders have vowed action, declaring a war on smog and embarking on an ambitious push to get more energy from renewable sources.
The three remaining cities on the list of the 10 with the dirtiest air were Tianjin, Jinan and Zhengzhou.
China has been strengthening its efforts to counter pollution. The nation last month said it will provide more support to non-governmental organizations that sue polluters.
Air quality in the Chinese cities of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei fell short of air standards on 57 percent of days, 5 percentage points lower than 2013, according to the statement. The Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta saw more days that met requirements.
Concentrations of PM2.5, fine air particles that pose the greatest health risk, averaged 85.9 micrograms per cubic meter in the capital, down 4 percent from a year earlier.
Shenzhen, Haikou and Lhasa were among the eight cities that met government standards for pollutants, the results showed.
