Bob Odenkirk and David Cross team up again for Netflix sketch show.
It’s not an exactly a reboot of Mr. Show with Bob and David, but it’s the next best thing: Bob Odenkirk and David Cross are joining comedy forces again for a Netflix sketch series.
The streaming service announced today that it has ordered four half-hour episodes of With Bob and David, along with an hourlong making-of special.
Here’s the official description of the series, which is being written by and stars the Better Call Saul lead and Arrested Development alum: “After being dishonorably discharged from the Navy Seals, Bob and David are back serving our country the way they do best, making sketch comedy.” Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! fame are among the show’s executive producers. You can get your first look at a sketch in the photo above.
After working together on The Ben Stiller Show, Odenkirk and Cross would go on to create the beloved HBO sketch comedy series Mr. Show, which ran from 1995 to 1998. The duo hit the road two years ago with a mini-tour. Anticipation of a new project and/or an event to mark Mr. Show’s 20th anniversary began building back in December, when Paul F. Tompkins tweeted a photo featuring some of the sketch comedy’s performers and writers with the words: “Eight men out… of the 1990s. Maybe something new coming from the Mr. Show gang in the new year? #MrShow.”
