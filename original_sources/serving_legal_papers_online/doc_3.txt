New York judge rules woman can serve divorce papers via Facebook message.
Manhattan supreme court judge issues ruling that allows woman to file for divorce from her hard-to-find husband via the social network.
A judge has given a New York City woman permission to file for divorce from her elusive husband via a Facebook message.
The woman’s lawyer says the ruling was made by Manhattan supreme court justice Matthew Cooper.
The Daily News says Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku will be served with the divorce summons via a private Facebook message. It will be repeated once a week for three consecutive weeks or until “acknowledged” by Ellanora Baidoo’s hard-to-find husband.
Attorney Andrew Spinnell says the couple married in 2009 in a civil ceremony. He says the relationship began to unravel when the defendant reneged on his promise to a traditional Ghanaian wedding ceremony as well.
The ruling says Blood-Dzraku has only been in touch with his wife via phone and Facebook.
