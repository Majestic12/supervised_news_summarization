Virgin America withdraws plans for secondary share offering.
Virgin America went public in Nov. 2014 and is now valued at more than $1.3 billion.
Virgin America said April 24 that it was no longer going to pursue a secondary offering of shares. The airline said shareholders had decided "not to proceed with an offering at this time."
Virgin America raised $300 million in a Nov. 2014 IPO that at the time valued the company at around $1 billion. The company will report its Q1 2015 earnings on April 30.
"Circa earlier today erroneously reported that Virgin America had withdrawn its plans for an IPO. Circa regrets the error."
The company began flights in 2007 and has long discussed going public. It is based in San Francisco and flies to about two dozen cities. It has been expanding access to additional airports available through a Justice Dept. agreement with US Airways and American Airlines in their merger.
