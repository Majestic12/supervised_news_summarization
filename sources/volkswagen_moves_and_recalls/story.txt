Volkswagen Chairman Ferdinand Piech unexpectedly resigns.
The resignation follows a power struggle with the company's CEO Martin Winterkorn.
Volkswagen announced on April 25 that Chairman Ferdinand Piech had resigned. The resignation comes after a power struggle with CEO Martin Winterkorn. Piech told Spiegel Online on April 10 that he was keeping his "distance" from Winterkorn. However, after supervisory board members backed Winterkorn, Piech also voiced support for him.
Piech, 78, was with Volkswagen for more than two decades and is one of the company's largest shareholders. Piech's wife, Ursula, also announced her resignation. Volkswagen said Berthold Huber will temporarily assume leadership of the supervisory board.
Volkswagen's US sales declined 13.4% reaching only 244,900 at the end of August, 2014. Issues around product quality not solely related to the company's Jetta and Beetle brands have had a negative effect on the company's earnings in the United States.
