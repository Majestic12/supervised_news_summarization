You Can Now Serve Divorce Papers on Facebook.
What to do if you need to serve divorce papers to a spouse that’s nowhere to be found, or dodging your calls and visits? Send them a Facebook message, of course. This is now an accepted way to start the process of ending a marriage.
A Manhattan Supreme Court Justice recently ruled that a 26-year-old woman named Ellanora Baidoo could serve her husband divorce paperwork “using a private message through Facebook,” the New York Daily News reports.
In this instance, Baidoo’s husband, Victor Sena Blood-Dzraku, is strangely hard to find. Blood-Dzraku doesn’t have a job. He hasn’t had an address since 2011. On top of that, the “post office has no forwarding address for him, there is no billing address linked to his prepaid cell phone, and the Department of Motor Vehicles has no record of him.” The man is a ghost—a ghost whose wife wants a divorce.
Blood-Dzraku apparently only communicates via phone and social media. Since the phone route hasn’t worked so far, Ellanora Baidoo will serve the divorce summons via Facebook message “once a week for three consecutive weeks or until acknowledged.” This isn’t the first time someone’s been allowed to serve legal paperwork on Facebook. However, it appears to be the first time a Facebook message has officially marked the end of a marriage. Probably not the last, sadly.
