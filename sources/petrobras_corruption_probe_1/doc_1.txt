Brazil Prosecutor Seeks to Block Leniency Deal in Petrobras Case.
Brazil's prosecutor is seeking to prevent agreements between the federal government and companies accused of involvement in a corruption scandal enveloping oil producer Petrobras from bidding on more state contracts.
Prosecutor Julio Marcelo de Oliveira on Friday sent a letter to the Brazilian Federal Audits Court asking for an order stopping some so-called leniency agreements, according to a copy of the document published on the Contas Abertas website, a non-governmental group that monitors fiscal accounts. The accords would allow companies to continue bidding on state contracts while cooperating with investigators.
Oliveira said some agreements could be permitted if companies and executives are fully cooperating with authorities into the investigation of alleged kickbacks at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, a case known as the Carwash scandal. In other situations, the agreements would hinder investigations, he said. Prosecutors are seeking about $1.6 billion in payments from companies allegedly involved in the case.
Allowing leniency deals would bring “complications to advances and the possibility of success of the investigations,” de Oliveira wrote. The testimony of business executives has been a key tool for investigators to date.
Officials at Brazil’s Federal Audits Court and Prosecutor’s office didn’t immediately respond to calls and e-mails from Bloomberg News seeking comment.
