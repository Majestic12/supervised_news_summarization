Netflix renews 'Daredevil' for second season.
It looks like Hell's Kitchen will stay safe for one more year.
After receiving widespread acclaim for its gritty series about one of Marvel Comics' lesser-known superheroes, Netflix has ordered a second season of "Daredevil," starring Charlie Cox as the titular Man Without Fear.
The streaming series' 13-episode first season, released earlier this month, chronicles Matt Murdock's struggle to erase graft and corruption from the neighborhood where he grew up. Vincent D'Onofrio plays Wilson Fisk, the crime lord known as the Kingpin who serves as Murdock's chief antagonist in the comics.
A bloody, dark tour that could bounce between morality play and action movie depending on the episode, "Daredevil" was praised as a departure from the levity of Marvel's other live-action ventures, anchored by "The Avengers" films.
"Daredevil" existed as a blood-soaked alternative to the smiling Captain America or quick-witted Iron Man franchises, and routinely portrays Matt Murdock as a grim protector who isn't above torturing criminals to gain information.
While little is known about the second season of the series, two mainstays of the Daredevil mythos were noticably absent from Season 1. Elektra Natchios, one of Murdock's great loves from the comics, was hinted at during a flashback in the first season, but never seen.
Bullseye, a lunatic assassin who is also a chief rival of Daredevil in the comics, has yet to appear in Hell's Kitchen either.
