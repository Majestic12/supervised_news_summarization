Cricket World Cup: Scotland 'must get over Afghanistan defeat'.
Scotland will need time to get over the disappointment of their one-wicket World Cup defeat by Afghanistan, according to captain Preston Mommsen.
Afghanistan recovered from 97-7 to overhaul 210 in the final over and deny Scotland a first World Cup win.
"It's a very difficult day," Mommsen told the BBC's Test Match Special. "There was a lot riding on this, a huge opportunity to get that first win.
"Regrettably, it wasn't to be. It will take a couple of days to get over it."
Scotland, who have never won a World Cup match, had earlier slumped to 144-8, only to be taken to their highest score in the tournament by a ninth-wicket partnership of 62 between Majid Haq and Alasdair Evans.
Afghanistan then suffered their own collapse of five wickets for 12 runs, but Samiullah Shenwari's 96 took them to the brink of victory, with last man Shapoor Zadran hitting the winning runs with three balls to spare.
"With the bat and the ball we got into winning positions, and in neither innings we managed the killer punch," said batsman Mommsen.
"I'm not sure what to put it down to. We threw everything at it.
"Small opportunities weren't taken and, the closer it got, the harder it got to bowl them out."
Scotland's 11th successive World Cup defeat in three tournaments since making their debut in 1999 is a record, and their third reverse in this campaign leaves them on the brink of elimination from quarter-final contention.
"It's going to be a huge challenge for us to respond to this," added 27-year-old Mommsen, whose team next play Bangladesh in Nelson on 4 March.
"We know Bangladesh are a side we're capable of beating. We've played good cricket in parts in the first three games, but not for long enough."
